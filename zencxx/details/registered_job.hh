/**
 * \todo Need to rewrite this class using \c boost::msm cuz jobs lifetime can be
 * really complicated. Nowadays we just have no such cases... but potentially we
 * may do...
 *
 * \todo It seems there is a different timer must be used depending on scheduled
 * call type:
 * \li steady clock for relative time calls
 * \li wall clock for absolute time calls
 *
 * \note This class contains non-copyable member, so the whole class non-copyable
 * as well! (I.e. no need to inherit from noncopyable explicitly)
