/// \note No need to specialize \c next or \c prior, cuz default implementation
/// will use iterator's \c next/prior types which are defined for \c seq_iter as well.

/// \note No need to specialize \c deref, default implementation just takes nested \c type of the
/// iterator type, which is pretty fine for \c seq_iter type.
